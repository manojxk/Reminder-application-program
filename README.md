# Reminder-application-program
 This project is similar to a To-Do List, where we have a set of goals to achieve. And the reminder app will constantly notify us about the various tasks we need to do and actions to complete throughout the course of the day.

For the purpose of completing the task exactly on **time**, we need to also import the time module, which will serve this purpose.The only other module we will require for the completion of this task is the **plyer** module.
**Plyer** is a Python library for accessing features of your hardware or other platforms.

Once the installation of the plyer module is complete, we can make use of the notification class in this library for the creation of our reminder application. This notification option allows us to run the script with the task scheduler. 

I will be alerting myself to take a break after every hour. Since I spend most of my time on the PC, it would be a great idea for me to take a break every now and then.
After an hour you should receive the following alert.
